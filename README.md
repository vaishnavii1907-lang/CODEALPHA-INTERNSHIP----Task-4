# CODEALPHA-INTERNSHIP----Task-4
PROJECT TITLE :
Advanced Sentiment Analysis on Text Data Using Machine Learning & NLP

Name: Vaishnavi K
Company: codealpha
Internship ID: CA/DE1/3618
Domain: Data Analytics / sentiment Analysis
Duration: 1st December to 30th December

This project implements sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing and lexicon-based techniques. Text data from sources such as product reviews, social media, and news articles were analyzed to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. VADER sentiment lexicon was used for emotion detection, and machine learning models were applied to understand public opinion and sentiment trends. The results can support marketing strategies, product development, and social insights.

🎯 OBJECTIVES
To perform in-depth sentiment analysis on textual data.
To apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text cleaning.
To convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization.
To train and compare multiple machine learning models.
To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
To visualize sentiment distribution and model results professionally.
To gain real-world experience applicable to Data Science & AI internships.

🧾 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Sentiment Analysis is a core NLP task used to identify emotional tone in text.
This project classifies user reviews into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments.
The system follows a complete machine learning pipeline:
