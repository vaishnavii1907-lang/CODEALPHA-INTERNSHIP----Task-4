# CODEALPHA-INTERNSHIP----Task-4
PROJECT TITLE
Advanced Sentiment Analysis on Text Data Using Machine Learning & NLP

This project implements sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing and lexicon-based techniques. Text data from sources such as product reviews, social media, and news articles were analyzed to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. VADER sentiment lexicon was used for emotion detection, and machine learning models were applied to understand public opinion and sentiment trends. The results can support marketing strategies, product development, and social insights.

🎯 OBJECTIVES
To perform in-depth sentiment analysis on textual data.
To apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text cleaning.
To convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization.
To train and compare multiple machine learning models.
To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
To visualize sentiment distribution and model results professionally.
To gain real-world experience applicable to Data Science & AI internships.
